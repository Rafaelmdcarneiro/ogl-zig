# ZGL â€“ Zig OpenGL Bindings

This library provides a thin, type-safe binding for OpenGL.

## Example

```zig
// Use classic OpenGL flavour
var vao = gl.createVertexArray();
defer gl.deleteVertexArray(vao);

// Use object oriented flavour
var vertex_buffer = gl.Buffer.create();
defer vertex_buffer.delete();
```

## Installation

Add zgl to your `build.zig.zon` with the following command:

`zig fetch --save https://github.com/ziglibs/zgl/archive/[commit_hash].tar.gz`

Replace [commit_hash] with the latest commit or tagged release.

Then add the following to your `build.zig`:

```zig
const zgl = b.dependency("zgl", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});
exe.root_module.addImport("zgl", zgl.module("zgl"));
```

Then import it with `const gl = @import("zgl");`, and build as normal with `zig build`.

## Development Philosophy

This library is developed incrementally. That means that functions and other things will be included on-demand and not just for the sake of completeness.

If you think a function is missing, fork the library, implement the missing function similar to the other functions and make a pull request. Issues that request implementation of missing functions will be closed immediatly.

## Generated Bindings

This library includes OpenGL 4.5 bindings, generated by [zig-opengl](https://github.com/MasterQ32/zig-opengl). Bindings for a different version may be substituted by replacing [binding.zig](binding.zig).
